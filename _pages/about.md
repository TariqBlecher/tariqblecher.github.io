A radio astronomer in a previous life, I take inspiration from science and mathematics to make an impact on real world problems.

I obtained my PhD from Rhodes University in 2021 in the field of galaxy evolution. My MSc work was cited in the first black hole image release which made global headlines in 2019. 

In my industry experience as a Data Scientist, I have worked on modelling wastewater treatment, optimising fibre planning and analytics for mobile network drive tests.
